We booked an American Girl Place package at Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park. Told that we'd have a room with a nice view, apparently their idea of a nice view is of another building! Ended up getting a smoking room when we booked non-smoking, cost us $100 more a night than we were told, and staff was incredibly rude at the restaurant. Would never recommend coming here for any reason whatsoever!
