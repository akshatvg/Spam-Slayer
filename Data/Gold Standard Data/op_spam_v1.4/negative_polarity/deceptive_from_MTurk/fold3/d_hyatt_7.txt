I expected a bit more from the Hyatt Regency Chicago I stayed at recently. I was appalled of the conditions of the room we stayed in. The linens were not clean, the toilet paper roll was nearly empty with no spare left, and there was a lock on the door that didn't function. The turndown service left me no chocolate on my pillow and I think they took a few more pieces of the already nearly empty toilet paper, again with out leaving a spare. I would not stay there again. Traveler beware!!
