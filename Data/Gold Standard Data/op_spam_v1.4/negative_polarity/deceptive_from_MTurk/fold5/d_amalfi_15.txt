I recently stayed at this hotel not to long ago. Sure, it looks nice, but it's really just a smoke screen. I went to the clerk to check in and she was VERY rude to me. I was asking about nearby attractions and she abruptly cut me off to tell me that I need to go find a phone book and ask someone else. She also encoded my key wrong, so I had to have it redone. I finaly get to my room, only to discover it was a mess. The sheets were thrown on the floor, the curtains were wide open and to top it all off, the toliet hadn't been flushed. It was horrible. I called the front desk to have a maid come and fix it up, but I was told they were on break. Whatever thoguh, I cleaned up myself. The night progresses and I awaken to the sound of someone beating on my door. Some guy said that I was in HIS room. It baffled me, but we went straight down to the lobby and got it cleared up. They had given his the wrong room. I couldn't take one more day of all the bull. I checked out early the next morning and stayed at a different hotel for the remainder of my visit to Chicago. I would NOT recommend this hotel to ANYONE.
