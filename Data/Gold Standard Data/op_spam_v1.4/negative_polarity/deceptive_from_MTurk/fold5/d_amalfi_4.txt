I needed to find a last minute hotel to stay in for the night so i came to this one. First of all the prices for one night are extremely high. The workers at the front desk were not kind at all and treated me like i was a second rate and not on their list of priorities. Then i got into my room and got settled and it smelled of cigarettes and the air conditioner was making loud sounds so i didnt get much sleep. Also the restroom was very dirty and frankly disgusting. The beds were very old and uncomfortable and the tv did not work at all. Overall i am very disappointed with this hotel.
