The InterContinental Chicago hotel terrible. First of all, the continental breakfast was a joke. The food was unhealthy and unsatisfactory. After our first night, we expected the maid to come clean up our room. We came back from site-seeing to find that our room was in the same condition we left it in. I will never go back to this hotel again.
