I had an awful experience here. The staff were rude and unhelpful. It took forever to check in and when I did, they took a while to even find my reservation. When I got to the room, it was marginally clean and when I complained, they said they were full and could not do anything for me. I would never go back. They are obviously not worried about customer service.
