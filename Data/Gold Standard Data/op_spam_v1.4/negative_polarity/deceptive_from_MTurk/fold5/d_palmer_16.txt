I recently stayed at the Palmer House Hilton on a business trip to Chicago. I will do my best to make sure that future employees of my company do I have to stay here. When the reservation was made, an early check-in was arranged -- due to travel arrangements, my travel companion and I were to get to the city in the early hours of the morning. We had arranged an early check-in without having to pay for the night before. There was no fuss raised when we agreed on this and so we assumed it would be fine. When we got there, however, there were no rooms available for us for hours and they refused to keep our bags. We were forced to change clothes and wash up in the public restrooms of the office building where our first meeting took place, and cart our bags around with us. They offered insincere apologies and didn't offer to comp us anything for the inconvenience. The rest of the stay (one night) was nothing to praise. I guess not having bugs would count as positive? I would definitely never recommend that anyone stay here.
