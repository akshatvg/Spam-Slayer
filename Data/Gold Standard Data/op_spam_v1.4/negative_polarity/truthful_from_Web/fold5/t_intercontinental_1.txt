I stayed here with a dozen of my friends, and more than half of us got eaten alive by bed bugs! We stayed there from September 28 - September 30th, but the symptoms (i.e. the crazy itchiness) didn't come until Sunday night when we all got home. I complained to the hotel and basically all they're gonna do is cover the cost of our dry cleaning bills. Honestly, they should reimburse us, because it was not worth it at all. DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL!!!
