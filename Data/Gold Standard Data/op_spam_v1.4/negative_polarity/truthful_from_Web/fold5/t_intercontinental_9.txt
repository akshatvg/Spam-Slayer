When you check into a hotel after being stuck in a airport, you areusually not in the best of mood. I, working in a upscale hotel, do encounter many guests checking in who this has happened to. All they want is a friendly face and a smooth check in. The desk clerk who checked me in at this property, did neither. She was short, rude, handed me my keys and walked away. I would never go back to this property due to this.
