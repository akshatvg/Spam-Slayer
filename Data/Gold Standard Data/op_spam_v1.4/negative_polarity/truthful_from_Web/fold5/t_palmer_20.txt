After Leaving some important documents in the room, I called and asked for the lost and found department... SEVEN TIMES over the course of a week. Eventually I had enough and asked for a manager and was put on hold then disconnected. Finally , a deceivingly friendly operator PROMISED me she would have someone call me back in a few minutes, It never happened. So Avoid this place because after they rip you off once they'll keep doing it later. They cannot be trusted at their word
