This hotel gives you a lot for a reasonable price! It has a great downtown location and a lot of added bonuses. We loved the evening cocktail hour with free alcoholic beverages and appetizers. They also have complimentary breakfast and complimentary dinner. The fitness center was very clean, I didn't want to leave it! Our room was a spacious suite with a kitchen included! And I took advantage of the free grocery delivery. Beds are comfortable and the room looks like it was recently renovated. But the thing that really stood out was the teamwork of such a wonderful staff. We will be back to the Homewood Suites the next time we come to Chicago!
