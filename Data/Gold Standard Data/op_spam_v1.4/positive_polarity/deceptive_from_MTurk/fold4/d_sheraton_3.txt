I stayed at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel for two nights and I must say the service they rendered was quite impressive. They had very attentive and friendly staff members. The room that I stayed in was spacious for me and my husband. Their hotel restaurant served the most delicious steaks I have tasted, I ordered a classic fillet mignon and it was cooked to perfection. I would definitely stay at this hotel again if ever I come back to Chicago and would absolutely highly recommend this to my friends and family.
