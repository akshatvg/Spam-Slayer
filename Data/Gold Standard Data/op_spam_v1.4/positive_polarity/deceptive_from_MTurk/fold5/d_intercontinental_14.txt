The Inter Continental is a great hotel. The staff was very friendly, and the accomidations were great. The room was clean and ready on time, and the indoor swimming pool was perfect considering Chicago's weather. Eno was simply AMAZING. Their wine selection is second to none. And the Turkey Pumpkin Curry at Zest was to die for.
