The Palmer House Hilton was recommended to me by a friend who had visited Chicago the previous summer. I was very happy with the location , and was able to visit the nearby Lake Michigan and Millennium park (beautiful!!). The rooms were good size , and the right amount of luxury for the price. I didn't use room service much , but when I did everything was in order.
