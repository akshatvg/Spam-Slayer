Staying at this hotel was one of the high points of a last minute, budget Valentines weekend trip for my husband and me. We got a great rate -- $70 -- on Priceline. Close to the subway (red line) and we got from O'Hare to the hotel in less than an hour for $3.50 for both of us. We were able to check in more than 4 hours early. Room was great -- very clean, good closet space and fantastic bedding. Had one expensive drink at the Irish bar, but the bartender's advice on restaurants and clubs to check out made it worth the price. Concierge was helpful, too. Overall, service was terrific, room was great and staying there was a treat. I would stay there again any time, especially at that price.
