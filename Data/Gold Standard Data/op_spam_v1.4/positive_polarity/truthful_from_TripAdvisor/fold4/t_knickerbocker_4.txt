I love this hotel. It is one of the best that I have stayed in. The lobby was beautiful and the room was nice and comfortable. The made services was terrific. No matter what time we left the room it was made up when we came back. I asked the maid for a couple of extras and she was very nice and friendly. That is what I liked about the hotel the staff was so nice and friendly. I was there with my daughter for a girl's weekend from Thursday - Sunday. Everyone from the doorman to the concierge to the people at the desk etc. was wonderful. I can't say enough good about this hotel. Yes the bathroom was small, but I wasn't moving into the room. I was just staying there a few days and was hardly in the room anyway. I will definitely stay there again
