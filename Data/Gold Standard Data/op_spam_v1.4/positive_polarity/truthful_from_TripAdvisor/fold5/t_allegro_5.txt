I've stayed at the Allegro a couple of times. Like the other Kimpton properties, it's a classic old hotel that's been beautifully updated. I found the staff to be cordial, and I really like their corporate culture. They're pet-friendly (although I wasn't travelling with the dog), I got a recycling bin in my room, Aveda products in the bath and they don't clean with toxic chemicals. The rooms aren't huge and the bathrooms aren't what you're going to get at a Hilton. What the Allegro lacks in square footage it more than makes up for in cool. OK, they may be a little pricey, but I'm willing to pay a bit more considering the higher cost of doing business responsibily.
