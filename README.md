Spam Slayer is a web app used to detect deceptions from Amazon products' reviews. Users can copy a link to the product and paste directly paste it to my page. Using my trained deep learning model, Spam Slayer will distinguish between true/fake reviews and show them an adjusted rating without fake reviews.
